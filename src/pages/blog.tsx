          A school for children in Nursery Kindergarten through Grade 1â€“9,
          Intertots Trilingual School places a strong emphasis on language
          skills among other subjects. They teach three languages: Thai,
          English, and Chinese. The first class begins at 7:10 am and ends at
          16:00. Each class has a different schedule depending on how much
          material needs to be learned; the older you are, the more lessons you
          need to learn. Lunch is served at 12:00 and is decently tasty; you can
          order food from the cafe if you need to, but you must be in grade 7 or
          higher to do so.
